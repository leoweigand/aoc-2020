# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 2020 in JavaScript and [Deno](https://deno.land/). I am using TypeScript files but only add types if the TS compiler asks to add them. I try to solve the puzzles without any dependencies other than the Deno [standard library](https://deno.land/std/). Some have tests that can be run with `deno test [FILE]`.

```sh
# Get result for day three, part one
deno run --allow-read getResult.ts 03 01
```
